        Greetings, everyone! My name is Ammon Caro Capate, and I am from General
        Santos City Philippines. I have some experience in front-end
        development, I learned all of it by myself from the internet. I really
        like the internet, there is so much possibily in there. I am a member of
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I serve my full time
        mission in Philippines, Quezon City Mission. I am 5 years married to my
        wife and we have a son named Azael Auron.
