          Greetings, everyone! My name is Ammon Caro Capate, and I am from General
          Santos City Philippines. I have some experience in front-end
          development, I learned all of it by myself from the internet. I really
          like the internet, there is so much possibily in there. I am a member of
          The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I serve my full time
          mission in Philippines, Quezon City Mission. I am 5 years married to my
          wife and we have a son named Azael Auron.
          
          Enrolling in a website development course has significantly elevated my 
          proficiency in crafting websites. Through this learning journey, not only 
          have I honed my skills, but I've also streamlined my workflow, enabling 
          me to work more efficiently.
        </p>
